Fragments of useful Nuxt features have been added to show implementation, such as middleware, serverMiddleware, and soon utilizing the Vuex store.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build

```
